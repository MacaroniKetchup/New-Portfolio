                Greetings, and welcome to my Portfolio!, To stat my name is Cory Styer. I started my coding journey when
                I started a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp back in December of 2022! Ever since I have loved the challenges
                and knowledge that I've gained from the bootcamp, and from it have gain an appreciation for coding. I've also discovered
                that I seem to grasp more of an understanding with back-end technologies involved in webdevelopment. But I am willing to learn
                more as I continue down the path of web development and face new challenges to overcome and expan my knowledge from learning something
                new every day! A couple of my interests include; Art, Animation, Comics, Gaming, Cars, and Cosplay! Which you can see a couple of my Cosplays
                from click the button to my Instagram in my contacts section below!

            </p>

                As I look towards the future and thing of what I wish to acomplish with my life, I wish to be able to join a career, that is willing
                to help me grow and continuously gain the knowledge I wish to learn. Coding is somethign that is able to scratch that itch.
                Gettitng the oportunity to create something but also learn something new from each and every project you work on it something I find interesting
                and fulfilling. As I say, "If you learned something new by the end of the day, you had a good day."

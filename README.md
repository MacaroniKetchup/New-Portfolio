## About Me

Im a person who like a challange and learn something new; living by the moto, "As long as you learn something new everyday, its a good day". I decided to learn coding a sevral months ago, and enrolled ina bootcamp, and have loved every second of it. Even with its challenges learning ways to overcome those challenges is rewarding, and I strive to continue furthging my knowledge as I push through every challenge that comes before me.
